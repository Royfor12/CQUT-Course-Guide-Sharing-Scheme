## News Report

While global luxury giants might be breathing a sigh of relief with financial reports showing 2016 was a year of growth in China, a research veteran tracking the industry for years remains concerned.  
`虽然全球奢侈品巨头可能因财报显示2016年中国市场增长而松了一口气，但多年来一直追踪该行业的研究专家仍然感到担忧。`  
Fashion company Coach recently reported its Greater China local-currency sales rose 6% in the fourth quarter of 2016, while watch maker Swatch spoke of "very good growth" in sales on the Chinese mainland from November to January.  
`时尚公司Coach最近报告称，2016年第四季度大中华区本币销售额增长了6%，而手表制造商Swatch则表示，去年11月至今年1月中国大陆的销售实现了"非常好的增长"。`  
However, chief researcher at Fortune Character Institute Zhou Ting said there was no guarantee growth would continue.  
`然而，财富品质研究院首席研究员周婷表示，增长能否持续没有保证。`  
She added that it remained to be seen when the luxury industry in China might bottom out.

## Long Conversation

### Script
Fay: Jerry, could you show me how to hold the racket?

## Passage

### Script
Textile production is dirty, dirty, dirty – a one of the dirtiest industries in the world in fact. Why? Partly because of the damage that cotton crops and synthetic fiber production inflicts on the environment, and partly because of seriously outdated manufacturing methods used to dye and finish fabric.  
`纺织生产非常非常脏——实际上是世界上最脏的行业之一。为什么？部分原因是棉花种植和合成纤维生产对环境造成的破坏，部分原因是用于染色和整理织物的严重过时的制造方法。`  
According to the United States Energy Administration, the textile industry in the U.S. is the 5th largest contributor to CO2 emissions in the country.  
`据美国能源管理局称，美国纺织业是该国二氧化碳排放量第五大的行业。`  
But enough of the depressing facts: As consumers are becoming increasingly aware and clothing manufacturers are stepping up to more environmental accountability, technology is taking off -- and there have been huge advances.  
`但令人沮丧的事实说够了：随着消费者越来越有环保意识，服装制造商也在承担更多环保责任，技术正在腾飞——已经取得了巨大进步。`  
Maybe it doesn't have the sexiest-sounding name, but the comprehensive technology known as Sequencing Batch Biofilter Granular Reactor is innovative indeed.  
`也许这个名字听起来不够酷，但被称为"序批式生物滤池颗粒反应器"的综合技术确实很有创新性。`  
The process helps remove the most toxic textile dyes components - the recalcitrant organic compounds - by breaking them down via ozone treatment, prior to the application of a wastewater bio-filtering technique. Unlike traditional biological systems, this innovative treatment filter relies on microorganisms growing in aggregates.  
`该工艺通过臭氧处理分解最有害的纺织染料成分——难降解有机化合物，然后再采用废水生物过滤技术。与传统生物系统不同，这种创新的处理滤池依赖于聚集体中生长的微生物。`  
The wastewater is poured over the microorganisms, which process pollutants, and each aggregate holds up to 10 times more microorganisms than traditional technologies, and produces 80 percent less sludge than conventional biological filters.  
`废水被倒在微生物上，由它们处理污染物，每个聚集体所含微生物数量是传统技术的10倍，产生的污泥比传统生物滤池少80%。`
