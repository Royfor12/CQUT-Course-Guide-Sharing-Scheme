## News Report

### Script
The e-scooter boom began in Santa Monica about 16 months ago. Electric scooters, owned by start-ups looking to mimic the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber, appeared around town. The idea was simple: Use a smartphone app to rent a scooter and then leave it at the end of the ride for the next person.  
`大约16个月前，电动滑板车热潮在圣塔莫尼卡兴起。由初创公司拥有的电动滑板车，试图模仿像Uber这样的网约车公司的成功，出现在城里各处。想法很简单：用智能手机应用租一辆滑板车，骑完后留给下一个人使用。`  
Soon, people in cities from San Francisco to Paris were complaining that the scooters were all over sidewalks — usually without the approval of local officials.  
`很快，从旧金山到巴黎的城市居民都在抱怨，这些滑板车遍布人行道——通常没有当地官员的批准。`  
In Portland, city officials worried that they would soon get their own flock of uninvited scooters. So they established a four-month pilot program with a limit on scooters and a requirement that companies share detailed data about trips and injuries.  
`在波特兰，市政官员担心他们很快也会迎来一批不请自来的滑板车。因此，他们设立了为期四个月的试点项目，对滑板车数量进行限制，并要求公司共享有关出行和受伤的详细数据。`  
That data offers the most detailed analysis of the impact of e-scooters on a city. Scooters often replaced short car trips in Portland, offering some support for one of the biggest selling points the companies have made to communities: They can help reduce congestion and pollution. And the scooters did not lead to as many injuries as some had feared.  
`这些数据为分析电动滑板车对城市的影响提供了最详细的依据。在波特兰，滑板车经常取代短途驾车，为公司向社区宣传的最大卖点之一提供了一些支持：它们有助于减少拥堵和污染。而且滑板车并没有像一些人担心的那样导致大量受伤。`

## Passage

### Script
Many domains, especially psychology, are concerned with the way science interacts with chance — particularly "serendipity" (accidents that, through sagacity, are transformed into opportunity). Psychologist Kevin Dunbar and colleagues estimate that between 30% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental in some sense.  
`许多领域，尤其是心理学，都关注科学与偶然性的关系——特别是"机缘巧合"（通过睿智将意外转化为机遇的事故）。心理学家凯文·邓巴及其同事估计，所有科学发现中有30%到50%在某种意义上都是偶然的。`  
Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister says a scientist must be "sagacious" (attentive and clever) to benefit from an accident. Dunbar quotes Louis Pasteur's saying that "Chance favors only the prepared mind". The prepared mind, Dunbar suggests, is one trained for observational rigor. Dunbar adds that there is a great deal of writing about the role that serendipity ("happy accidents") plays in the scientific method.  
`心理学家艾伦·鲍迈斯特说，科学家必须"睿智"（专注且聪明）才能从意外中受益。邓巴引用路易·巴斯德的话："机遇只偏爱有准备的头脑"。邓巴认为，有准备的头脑是经过严格观察训练的。邓巴还补充说，有大量关于机缘巧合在科学方法中作用的著述。`  
Research suggests that scientists are taught various heuristics (a method of solving problems by finding practical ways of dealing with them) and practices that allow their investigations to benefit, and not suffer, from accidents. First, careful control conditions allow scientists to properly identify something as "unexpected". Once a finding is recognized as legitimately unexpected and in need of explaining, researchers can attempt to explain it: They work across various disciplines (subjects studied or taught at universities), with various colleagues, trying various analogies in order to understand the first curious finding. This means scientists themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played though they often call their accidental discoveries lucky.  
`研究表明，科学家们会学习各种启发式方法（通过实际方法解决问题的方法）和实践，使他们的研究能够从意外中受益而不是受损。首先，严格的控制条件使科学家能够正确地识别"意外"。一旦发现被认为确实是意外且需要解释，研究人员就会尝试解释它：他们会跨学科、与不同同事合作，尝试各种类比，以理解最初的奇怪发现。这意味着科学家们自己可能无法详细说明运气到底起了什么作用，尽管他们常常称自己的偶然发现是幸运的。`  
Anyway it is believed that scientific discoveries are the result of carefully prepared experiments, but also "prepared minds".  
`总之，人们认为科学发现既是精心设计实验的结果，也是"有准备的头脑"的结果。`
