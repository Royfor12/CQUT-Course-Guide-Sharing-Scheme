Primates face one common threat: loss of habitat, the places in nature where they live. Primatologists like Jo Setchell say human activity is to blame.  
`灵长类动物面临着一个共同威胁：栖息地的丧失，也就是它们在自然界中的生存之地。像Jo Setchell这样的灵长类动物学家认为，人类活动是罪魁祸首。`  
More than half of all primate species are grouped in four countries: Brazil, Indonesia, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
`全球一半以上的灵长类动物分布在四个国家：巴西、印度尼西亚、马达加斯加和刚果（金）。`  
Another primatologist Paul Garber says each of these countries is working to help protect the primates in their areas. “But often, there is neither the funds, community support nor in-country expertise to address their conservation problems.”  
`另一位灵长类动物学家Paul Garber说，这些国家都在努力保护本国的灵长类动物。“但通常缺乏资金、社区支持和本国专业知识来解决保护问题。”`  
Madagascar is a good example of these problems, he says. It is home to over 100 primate species; almost all of them live nowhere else. And 94 percent of them are endangered. Ninety percent of the original forests of Madagascar have been cut down, Garber says.   
`他说，马达加斯加就是这些问题的一个典型例子。那里有100多种灵长类动物，几乎全部为该地特有。其中94%处于濒危状态。Garber说，马达加斯加90%的原始森林已被砍伐。`  
Neither Garber nor Setchell have any easy answers about how to stop this road to extinction.  
`Garber和Setchell都没有关于如何阻止灭绝之路的简单答案。`  
They do say the clearest way is to slow human activity in primates' habitats. They also say the decrease is reversible if humans make primate habitat conservation a top concern.  
`他们表示，最明确的办法是减少人类在灵长类动物栖息地的活动。他们还说，如果人类把保护灵长类动物栖息地作为首要任务，数量下降是可以逆转的。`

## Passage

### Script
What better way to get to know China than through hanging out with its wonderful creatures? Planeterra is a non-profit organization. It organizes trips for travelers. Project China is a 14-day trip through several provinces of China. It includes four days of panda-sitting time at Bifengxia Panda Centre. Some of the less than 1,000 giant pandas left in the world live there.  
`还有什么比和中国的神奇动物一起度过更能了解中国的方式呢？Planeterra是一个非营利组织，专为旅行者组织行程。"中国项目"是一次为期14天、穿越中国多个省份的旅行，其中包括在碧峰峡大熊猫中心照看大熊猫的四天。世界上不足1000只的大熊猫中，有一些就生活在那里。`  
The two-week long trip includes visits to the markets in Shanghai, the Terra Cotta Warriors in Xi'an, the Forbidden City, and the Shaolin Temple. But the experience you'll never forget is the four days spent at Bifengxia. Volunteers meet with Centre researchers to learn about the challenges in breeding the pandas. They'll also learn more about the 14 cubs born at Bifengxia. They are the cubs of the 65 pandas relocated after the Wenchuan Earthquake. Volunteers will assist the researchers with varying tasks. Activities might include gathering food for the pandas or cleaning their habitats.  
`这趟为期两周的旅行还包括参观上海的集市、西安的兵马俑、故宫和少林寺。但最难忘的经历是碧峰峡的四天。志愿者会和中心的研究人员交流，了解大熊猫繁育的挑战，还会了解碧峰峡出生的14只幼崽，它们是汶川地震后迁入的65只大熊猫的后代。志愿者将协助研究人员完成各种任务，比如为大熊猫采集食物或清理栖息地。`  
"There are not a lot of places you can volunteer with pandas…this is a highlight of the trips we currently offer doing wildlife conservation in Asia," said Manning. The trip costs $1,899 per person, with departures from June to October. Accommodations throughout the trip, Manning noted, will be "largely small hotels and guest houses," and meals which are not included, will cost about $4-6 a piece.  
`Manning说："能和大熊猫一起做志愿者的地方不多……这是我们目前在亚洲开展野生动物保护旅行的亮点。"这次旅行每人1899美元，出发时间为6月至10月。Manning指出，整个行程主要住小酒店和家庭旅馆，餐费自理，每餐约4-6美元。`  
Whether it's your first or fifth time to China, Planeterra's Project China offers you the chance to establish a unique bond with China by helping to preserve its precious pandas.  
`无论你是第一次还是第五次来中国，Planeterra的"中国项目"都能让你通过保护珍稀大熊猫，与中国建立独特的联系。`
