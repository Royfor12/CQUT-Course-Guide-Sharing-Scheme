While designers have long been inspired by nature, the idea that the world around us can be used as a 3.8-billion-year-old R&D lab for technology development is gaining momentum. Benyus, author of Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature and founder of the nonprofit Biomimicry Institute, reviewed dozens of examples she and her colleagues have come across while reviewing scientific literature.  
`虽然设计师们长期以来一直受到大自然的启发，但将我们周围的世界视为一个38亿年历史的技术研发实验室的想法正日益流行。Benyus是《仿生学：受大自然启发的创新》一书的作者，也是非营利性仿生学研究所的创始人，她和同事们在查阅科学文献时总结了许多案例。`  
“We went through the biological literature. We had a list of life’s greatest sustainability challenges on our left hand and on our right we had scientific papers and we filtered through,” she said. “When we finally had to stop we had over 2100 phenomenal ideas. Things that have been mimicked, things that should be mimicked and have not yet been.”  
`她说：“我们查阅了生物学文献。左手是生命最大的可持续性挑战清单，右手是科学论文，我们逐一筛选。” “当我们最终不得不停下来时，我们已经有了2100多个惊人的想法。有些已经被模仿，有些应该被模仿但还没有。”`  
Benyus organized the ideas by function and found that nature has come up with many approaches to solving difficult challenges that presently confront humankind, including 49 new ways to generate energy, 23 new ways to absorb water and 44 ways to store it, 58 new ways to manage extreme temperatures, 42 new ways to cooperate, and more than 180 ways to communicate.  
`Benyus按功能对这些想法进行了整理，发现大自然已经提出了许多解决人类当前面临的难题的方法，包括49种新的能源获取方式、23种吸收水分的新方法和44种储水方法、58种应对极端温度的新方法、42种合作方式以及180多种交流方式。`

## Long Conversation

### Script
M：Jane, what’s that in your hand?  
`男：Jane，你手里拿的是什么？`  
W：Come on, Don. Haven’t you seen a cigarette before? Every day in the United States, about 1,500 girls begin smoking, and I figured, why not do my share?  
`女：得了吧，Don。你没见过香烟吗？在美国，每天大约有1500个女孩开始吸烟，我想，为什么我不能也来一根？`  
M：But Jane, don’t you know that tobacco kills more than 140,000 women each year, and that half  of those women are between the ages of thirty-five and sixty-nine?  
`男：但是Jane，你难道不知道烟草每年导致超过14万女性死亡，其中一半年龄在35到69岁之间吗？`  
W：Yeah. But that’s why I smoke a brand with low nicotine and tar content.  
`女：知道啊，所以我抽的是低尼古丁和低焦油的香烟。`  
M：Although tobacco companies advertise some cigarettes as "light", this is just an advertising ploy to obscure the risks associated with smoking – smoking a light cigarette is just as risky as smoking a regular one.   
`男：虽然烟草公司把一些香烟宣传为"低焦油"，但这只是掩盖吸烟风险的广告手段——抽低焦油香烟和普通香烟一样有害。`  
W：I didn’t know that.   
`女：我不知道。`  
M：The one thing you can say about tobacco companies is that they are really savvy about marketing. While tobacco ads that target men focus on cigarettes as macho or cool, tobacco ads that target women focus on social and political themes important to women.   
`男：你可以说烟草公司在营销方面确实很精明。针对男性的烟草广告强调阳刚或酷，针对女性的烟草广告则关注女性关心的社会和政治主题。`  
W: Interesting. Tell me more.  
`女：有意思，继续说。`  
M: For example, ads will say that you’ve come a long way, or encourage you to just be yourself, as if smoking has anything to do with progress and self-expression. Young women are especially vulnerable to these ads because addiction, disease, and premature death seem so remote to them. And the thing is, people who have smoked as few as one hundred cigarettes report having difficulty quitting.   
`男：比如广告会说你已经取得了很大进步，或者鼓励你做自己，好像吸烟和进步、自我表达有关。年轻女性尤其容易受到这些广告影响，因为她们觉得上瘾、疾病和早逝离自己很远。事实上，哪怕只抽过一百支烟的人都说很难戒烟。`  
W：So, Don, can you pass me that ashtray?  
`女：所以，Don，你能把烟灰缸递给我吗？`  
M：With pleasure, Jane, as long as you put it out.  
`男：很乐意，Jane，只要你把烟掐了。`
