Climate change could have a big impact on human, animal and plant health by making it easier for diseases to spread. Rising temperatures are changing environments and removing some of the natural barriers of various bacteria so that they could cause more diseases to human beings and other animals as well. This phenomenon is serious in the arctic and in warmer oceans. For example, in the arctic there are worms that affect the polar bears, and the worms are developing faster than before. And then in tropical oceans, there's a large amount of evidence that bacteria are increasing due to the change in ocean temperature.  
`气候变化可能会通过让疾病更容易传播，对人类、动物和植物健康产生巨大影响。气温上升正在改变环境，并消除各种细菌的一些天然屏障，使它们能够对人类和其他动物造成更多疾病。这一现象在北极和温暖的海洋中尤为严重。例如，在北极，有影响北极熊的蠕虫，这些蠕虫比以前发育得更快。而在热带海洋中，有大量证据表明，由于海洋温度的变化，细菌数量正在增加。`  
In developing countries, the diseases may affect agriculture and wildlife and therefore could affect food security and the lives of local people. We should know what's needed to help us predict and ultimately manage disease outbreaks in people and animals and plants. Modern health care and medications are considered to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of a lot of diseases. In the next five to ten years scientists will be able to find solutions to the diseases associated with climate change.  
`在发展中国家，这些疾病可能影响农业和野生动物，因此可能影响粮食安全和当地人民的生活。我们应该了解需要什么来帮助我们预测并最终管理人类、动物和植物的疾病爆发。现代医疗和药物被认为是预防许多疾病爆发的最有效方法。在接下来的五到十年里，科学家们将能够找到与气候变化相关疾病的解决方案。`  
The effects of climate change will last over decades. So it's vital to develop a long-term plan and do plenty of research work. Probably, crop management may be a good example to follow. It has a long history of tracking disease outbreaks, predicting potential threats and responding to those threats early.  
`气候变化的影响将持续数十年。因此，制定长期计划并进行大量研究工作至关重要。作物管理可能是一个很好的借鉴例子。它在追踪疾病爆发、预测潜在威胁和及早应对这些威胁方面有着悠久的历史。`

## Passage

### Script
Microwave cooking is probably the best cooking discovery since fire. In fact, it might be better than fire, since microwaves, instead of a flame or an electric element, cook the food.  
`微波烹饪可能是自火以来最伟大的烹饪发现。事实上，它甚至可能比火更好，因为微波炉不是用火焰或电热元件，而是用微波来加热食物。`  
Similar to heat and light waves, microwaves are short radio waves. They work by motion. They cause the molecules (分子) in food to move, which produces friction (摩擦力)．It's similar to rubbing your hands together when they're cold. The friction produces heat in the food, and the heat cooks the food.  
`和热波、光波类似，微波是一种短射频波。它们通过运动起作用。它们使食物中的分子运动，产生摩擦力。这就像你冷的时候搓手一样。摩擦会在食物中产生热量，这些热量把食物煮熟。`  
There is a legend behind the use of microwaves for cooking.  
`关于用微波烹饪有一个传说。`  
Percy Le Spencer was employed by the Raytheon Company during World War II. One day in 1942 he was working with a substance which produces microwaves. When he pulled a candy bar from his pocket, it was a melted mess. Although Spencer was working on scientific experiments, not trying to invent a new way of cooking, he realized that it was the microwaves that had melted the candy. Spencer knew that if microwaves melted candy, they would cook other foods as well．  
`二战期间，珀西·斯宾塞在雷神公司工作。1942年的一天，他在研究一种能产生微波的物质。当他从口袋里拿出一块糖时，发现它已经融化成一团糊状。虽然斯宾塞当时是在做科学实验，并不是想发明新的烹饪方式，但他意识到是微波融化了糖果。斯宾塞知道，如果微波能融化糖果，也能烹饪其他食物。`  
In fact the first microwave ovens were suspected of causing health problems, but the new models are safe. And now microwave cooking can be found in many homes all over the world.  
`事实上，最早的微波炉曾被怀疑会带来健康问题，但新型号是安全的。现在，微波烹饪在世界各地的许多家庭中都能见到。`
