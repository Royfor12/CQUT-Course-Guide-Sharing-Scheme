Four young musicians, two Israeli Jews, two Israeli Arabs, are in New York. They are going to perform as the Polyphony Quartet. It is a group created by the Israel-based Polyphony Foundation.  
`四位年轻音乐家，两位以色列犹太人，两位以色列阿拉伯人，正在纽约。他们将以"复调四重奏"身份演出。这是以色列复调基金会创建的一个团体。`  
In 2006 at a small school in Nazareth, Polyphony began to bring classical music to Arab children, says founder and music director Nabeel Abboud-Ashkar.  
`创始人兼音乐总监Nabeel Abboud-Ashkar说，2006年，复调在拿撒勒的一所小学校开始把古典音乐带给阿拉伯儿童。`  
"There was never a real proper opportunity for young Arab children to learn classical music. And this is what we were able to change." said Abboud-Ashkar.  
`Abboud-Ashkar说："阿拉伯孩子从未真正有机会学习古典音乐，而我们改变了这一点。"`  
The school flourished. Most of the teachers are Israeli Jews. They drove two hours from Tel Aviv to teach the children. Polyphony was formed to further music education. It brings together young Palestinian students to perform with their Jewish peers. Friendships developed among people who would otherwise have no reason to meet.  
`学校发展得很好。大多数老师是以色列犹太人，他们从特拉维夫驱车两小时来教孩子们。复调的成立是为了进一步推动音乐教育，让年轻的巴勒斯坦学生和犹太同龄人一起演出。原本不会相遇的人之间建立了友谊。`  
Among those listening were Polyphony co-founders Craig and Debora Cogut. Their financial support has expanded the program to train 130 young musicians. And this year, Polyphony's music education programs in elementary schools and kindergartens are projected to reach 10,000 other young, Israeli Arabs.  
`在观众中有复调的联合创始人Craig和Debora Cogut。他们的资金支持使该项目扩展到培训130名年轻音乐家。今年，复调在小学和幼儿园的音乐教育项目预计将覆盖1万名以色列阿拉伯儿童。`

## Passage

### Script
The power of music is a beautiful thing. When you're sad, you listen to pleasant tunes that help you feel comfortable. When you're trying to get into the mood for a great workout, you listen to music that boosts your energy and makes you want to climb mountains and sing along. For every feeling you have, there is a certain song that just speaks to you and makes you feel better inside, and that's why we like music so much: for the emotion it provides us.  
`音乐的力量是美妙的。当你难过时，你会听一些让你舒服的旋律；当你想锻炼时，你会听能让你充满能量、想爬山、想跟着唱的音乐。每种情绪都有一首歌能打动你，让你内心变好，这就是我们如此喜欢音乐的原因——它带来的情感。`  
It's important here to make the difference between an emotion and a feeling. It is often believed that feelings and emotions are the same thing, when they are actually slightly different. When you feel, there are senses in your brain that are active in order to detect what you feel through your inputs, such as the six senses, stress, pleasure, pressure, or motion. Emotions are the meaning of each feeling and are short lived. Emotions are more powerful than feelings, as they can be a great motivational source when played with. Some emotions include happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. Research shows that music does not affect the way you feel, but does create certain movements in the brain that induce certain emotions.  
`这里要区分情感和感觉。人们常以为感觉和情感是一样的，其实略有不同。感觉是大脑通过各种输入（如六感、压力、愉悦、压力或运动）来感知的。情感是每种感觉的意义，而且持续时间很短。情感比感觉更有力量，因为它们可以成为很强的动力来源。情感包括快乐、悲伤、恐惧和愤怒等。研究表明，音乐不会影响你的感觉，但会在大脑中产生某些运动，从而引发特定情感。`  
All in all, depending on the type of music you listen to, your emotions can be affected differently. So next time you have your earphone plugged in, take note of the way you feel when listening to certain songs. See how your emotions react, how you feel on the inside, when the guitar starts playing or the sound of the piano is in your ears. Being considerate of these things will allow you to have better control over your body, as you're more aware of your emotions.  
`总之，听什么类型的音乐会影响你的情感。下次戴上耳机听歌时，注意一下自己的感受。看看当吉他响起或钢琴声在耳边时，你的情感如何反应、内心如何变化。关注这些会让你更好地掌控身体，因为你会更了解自己的情感。`
