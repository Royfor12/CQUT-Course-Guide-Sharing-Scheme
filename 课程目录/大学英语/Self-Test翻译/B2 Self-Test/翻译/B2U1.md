## Passage

Nine-year-old Ben Pierce of Denton, Texas, isn't blind – at least not yet.  
`德克萨斯州丹顿市九岁的本·皮尔斯并没有失明——至少现在还没有。`

Born 17 weeks premature, Ben suffers from a condition that is slowly stealing his sight. He has already lost his peripheral vision. His parents, Dan and Heidi, say the rest is fading fast.  
`本早产17周，患有一种慢慢夺去他视力的疾病。他已经失去了周边视力。他的父母丹和海蒂说，其余的视力正在迅速衰退。`

"And so our goal became, what can we help him experience, to store up these memories," said Heidi Pierce. "And we sat him down and said, 'What do you think would be cool to see? What's on your wish list?'"  
`"因此，我们的目标变成了，我们能帮助他体验什么，来储存这些记忆，"海蒂·皮尔斯说。"我们让他坐下来说，'你觉得看什么会很酷？你的愿望清单上有什么？'"`

For the last year, the Pierces have been crossing sites off Ben's before-I-go-blind-bucket-list.  
`在过去的一年里，皮尔斯一家一直在本的"失明前遗愿清单"上划掉景点。`

They have explored everything from the depths of Arizona to high above Alaska. From places they can go in their van to faraway Van Goghs.  
`他们探索了从亚利桑那州的深处到阿拉斯加的高空的一切。从他们可以用面包车去的地方到遥远的梵高画作。`

He is nine - which is also reflected in the list itself.  
`他九岁了——这也反映在清单本身。`

"He wanted to see the inside of the Apple store," said Heidi. "And his enthusiasm about seeing these things, his joy, is contagious."  
`"他想看看苹果商店的内部，"海蒂说。"他看到这些东西的热情，他的喜悦，是会传染的。"`

Today it's chalk under a microscope. That was actually on the list. His parents really are trying to cram in as many different visuals as they can.  
`今天是在显微镜下看粉笔。这实际上在清单上。他的父母真的在尽力塞进尽可能多的不同视觉效果。`

"He'll be able to talk about what the ocean is like with his kids," said Dan.  
`"他将能够和他的孩子们谈论海洋是什么样的，"丹说。`

"And he will remember in his mind what that looks like because he was there before," said Heidi.  
`"他会在脑海中记住那是什么样子，因为他以前去过那里，"海蒂说。`

When asked if he realizes how lucky he is that his parents are making all this happen Ben got a little emotional. He considered that for quite a while – then asked a question:  
`当被问及他是否意识到父母为他做这一切是多么幸运时，本变得有些情绪化。他考虑了很长一段时间——然后问了一个问题：`

"Do you have a pencil?"  
`"你有铅笔吗？"`

As his parents later explained, when Ben finds a question too emotional to answer, he prefers to draw it out. This time what he drew equals, "Yes! I'm thankful!" though the picture looked like doodles.  
`正如他的父母后来解释的那样，当本发现一个问题情绪上太难回答时，他更喜欢把它画出来。这次他画的东西相当于，"是的！我很感激！"尽管这幅画看起来像涂鸦。`

Ben may be losing his eyesight, but he clearly sees what he's got.  
`本可能正在失去视力，但他清楚地看到了他所拥有的。`
