## News Report

### Script
Jessica McLeod, a former drug user who had lost everything, sat with a group of counselors in a South Boston meeting room recently, huddled over a pile of papers. Together, the group was setting up a plan to dig her out of poverty. The plan was "Get a job, pay off old debts, enroll in nursing classes." and the deadlines were set.  
`Jessica McLeod曾是一名吸毒者，失去了一切。最近，她和一群顾问坐在南波士顿的一个会议室里，围着一堆文件。大家一起制定了一个让她摆脱贫困的计划。计划内容包括"找工作、还清旧债、报名护理课程"，并设定了完成期限。`  
Each time McLeod, 32, meets one of her goals, she will get a small bonus in a novel program. The Career Family Opportunity program gives 19 single parents anything from $50 for showing up for a doctor's appointment to $500 for finishing a year of college. Organizers hope the rewards will help motivate women like McLeod to take many small steps toward a life free of poverty and welfare.  
`每当32岁的McLeod完成一个目标，她就会在一个新颖的项目中获得一笔小奖励。职业家庭机会项目为19位单亲家长提供各种奖励，从去看医生可得50美元，到完成一年大学课程可得500美元。组织者希望这些奖励能激励像McLeod这样的女性迈出许多小步，走向摆脱贫困和救济的生活。`  
And the program director said with a little financial incentive, women participating in the program had something to work toward. Some who had dropped out of school are in college. Others who had not worked are now employed. Many are budgeting and sharing their ideas with their children and peers.  
`项目负责人表示，有了些许经济激励，参与项目的女性就有了奋斗目标。有些辍学的人现在上了大学，有些从未工作过的人现在有了工作，许多人还在做预算，并与孩子和同伴分享自己的想法。`

## Passage

### Script
Charities are just as vulnerable, if not more so, to economic weakness as are corporations. The way the economy goes determines how charity goes.  
`慈善机构和企业一样，甚至更容易受到经济疲软的影响。经济形势如何，慈善事业也会随之变化。`  
Total giving figures for last year will not be available until June, but many charities are reporting lower income from donations. Surveys of the largest 100 United Ways in December and January suggest a decline of 2% to 5.6% in giving this year. More than half of the United Ways – 58% –   are expecting a drop this year. In addition, 82% are anticipating higher rates of uncollectible pledges. Some areas have been hit harder than others. For example, the United Way in Elkhart, Indiana, expects a 50% drop in donations. The city, which was visited Monday by President Barack Obama, has a 15% unemployment rate.  
`去年捐赠总额要到今年六月才会公布，但许多慈善机构已经报告捐款收入下降。对最大的一百家联合劝募机构的调查显示，今年捐赠额预计下降2%到5.6%。超过一半的联合劝募机构——58%——预计今年会减少捐赠。此外，82%预计无法收回的承诺款项比例会上升。有些地区受影响更大。例如印第安纳州埃尔克哈特的联合劝募机构预计捐赠将下降50%。该市失业率为15%，奥巴马总统本周一还曾到访。`  
But the nation's economic travails have coincided with an increase in volunteerism, and even if the predicted declines prove true, the United Way is still likely to raise more than $4 billion this year.  
`但全国经济困境的同时，志愿服务却在增加。即使捐赠下降的预测成真，联合劝募机构今年仍有望筹集到超过40亿美元。`  
It will be needed, since demand has spiked, with calls to the United Way's hotline increasing for financial assistance to cover basic needs like food, shelter and clothing.  
`这笔钱很有必要，因为需求激增，打电话到联合劝募热线寻求食物、住所和衣物等基本需求资助的人越来越多。`  
United Way's biggest drop in donations occurred in 1932, when they fell by 24%, followed by two more years of increasingly smaller declines until 1935, when growth resumed.  
`联合劝募机构捐赠额最大降幅出现在1932年，当年下降了24%，之后两年降幅逐渐缩小，直到1935年才恢复增长。`
